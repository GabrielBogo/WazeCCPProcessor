1. IAM credentials
------------------
It is assumed that credentials are available to run both the following commands
and to execute the real infrastructure provisioning process. It may be
preferable to generate a set of creds with attached policies that only allow the
specific actions necessary to manage the exact set of resources that we'll be
provisioning, but that will be an exercise left to the end user.  Either way, in
order to avoid any "chicken or egg" scenario, we assume proper credentials
already exist.


2. Artifacts bucket
------------------
Since we'll be deploying Lambda functions, we'll need a place to keep deployment
artifacts.  We need this bucket to already exist (and have said artifacts in it)
when we provision the Lambda resources, so we are creating it outside of our
main process.  You could choose to do this via the console, but below is the cli
command that can be used as well.  Remember that bucket names must be globally
unique, so you'll need to plug in the name you want, and you'll need to provide
this name when provisioning all of the other resources later.  Also, feel free
to use a different region, but know that you may need to do add more to the
command call if you do.

> aws s3api create-bucket --bucket YOUR-UNIQUE-ARTIFACT-BUCKET-NAME --region us-east-1


3. Terraform state management bucket
------------------
Because we are using Terraform for provisioning and using S3 state management (which is
the setup in the supplied Terraform scripts), you'll also need a bucket for
storing Terraform state.

> aws s3api create-bucket --bucket YOUR-UNIQUE-TERRAFORM-STATE-BUCKET-NAME --region us-east-1
